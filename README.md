# Spectre

![Spectre](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1897842/31115297-0fe2c3aa-a822-11e7-90e6-92ceccf76137.jpg)

Spectre is a versatile tool used for analysis of MALDI-MSI data sets.
This repository contains DiviK algorithm worker implementation.

For the sake of simplicity, the toolset provided is available to be used
through web application interface, which is currently a work-in-progress.

## Install

### Spectre service & web application

The Web service is all the time available [here](http://vaei-bit01.aei.polsl.pl/).
If you still would like to host it yourself, please contact us by
[e-mail](mailto:Grzegorz.Mrukwa@polsl.pl). We will provide you with exhaustive
explanation.

## Exemplary usage

### Spectre service & web application

The application is available online [here](http://vaei-bit01.aei.polsl.pl/).

Right now, our web application allows only for an interactive visualization
of some of the data we were using in the research, along with Divisive
Intelligent K-means algorithm results. More features will get documented
when they appear.

## How to contribute?

Please contact us by [e-mail](mailto:Grzegorz.Mrukwa@polsl.pl). We will answer
you in details.

Short contribution guide is actively constructed on
[the project's wiki](https://github.com/spectre-team/spectre/wiki)
as the development progresses.
